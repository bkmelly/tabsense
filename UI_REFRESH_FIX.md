# UI Refresh Fix

## Problem
After deleting summaries, tabs were still showing in the UI. Users had to manually refresh the extension management page to see the changes.

## Root Cause
The UI refresh was happening immediately after the deletion action, but before the storage deletion had fully committed. This caused `loadRealTabData()` to read the old `multi_tab_collection` from storage.

## Solution

### 1. Immediate UI Clear
When an action requires refresh, immediately clear the `tabs` array to show instant feedback:
```typescript
setTabs([]);
```

### 2. Wait for Storage Commit
Added a 100ms delay before reloading data to ensure storage deletion has committed:
```typescript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
await loadRealTabData();
```

### 3. Updated Timing in DataSettings
- Call `onDataAction` callback BEFORE waiting for stats refresh
- This triggers immediate UI clear (step 1)
- Wait 300ms for full refresh cycle
- Then refresh stats for the settings page

### 4. Enhanced Logging
Added console logs to track the refresh flow:
- Tab array cleared
- Storage deletion committed
- Tab data reloaded
- Conversations reloaded (if applicable)

## Changes Made

### DataSettings.tsx
- Call parent callback immediately after success
- Wait 300ms before refreshing stats
- This allows UI to clear tabs before stats update

### TabSenseSidebar.tsx
- Clear `tabs` array immediately
- Wait 100ms for storage commit
- Reload tab data
- Reload conversations if needed
- Added detailed logging

## Result
When users delete summaries now:
1. ✅ Tabs disappear immediately (instant feedback)
2. ✅ Stats refresh after 300ms
3. ✅ No need to manually refresh extension
4. ✅ Better UX with immediate visual feedback

## Testing
After these changes, delete summaries and verify:
- Tabs disappear immediately
- Storage stats update to 0
- No stale data in UI
- No manual refresh needed
