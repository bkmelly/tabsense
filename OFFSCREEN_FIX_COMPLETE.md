# Offscreen Document Fix - Complete

## Issue Resolved
The offscreen document was failing to initialize because it tried to use `chrome.storage.local`, which is **not available in offscreen document contexts**.

## Root Cause
Several modules (`CredentialManager`, `CachingManager`, `AdaptiveSummarizer`) attempted to access `chrome.storage.local` during initialization, causing the offscreen document to fail with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'local')
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Modules
- Removed `CredentialManager` - uses chrome.storage.local
- Removed `ContextEnhancer` - likely uses chrome.storage.local
- Kept `ContentScorer` and `enhancedCategorizer` - don't use storage
- Modified `AdaptiveSummarizer` initialization to be lazy (only when API key is available)

### 2. Modified Adaptive Summarization Flow
Instead of initializing `AdaptiveSummarizer` at startup, we now:
1. Request API keys from the service worker via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
2. Create `AdaptiveSummarizer` instance only when we have a valid API key
3. Pass the API key to the constructor: `new AdaptiveSummarizer(geminiKey, 'gemini-2.0-flash')`

### 3. Simplified Initialization
```javascript
async function initializeHeavyModules() {
  console.log('[TabSense Offscreen] Initializing heavy modules...');
  
  // Skip CredentialManager (not available in offscreen context)
  console.log('[TabSense Offscreen] Skipping CredentialManager (not available in offscreen context)');
  
  // ContentScorer doesn't use storage, safe to initialize
  contentScorer = new ContentScorer();
  console.log('[TabSense Offscreen] ContentScorer initialized');
  
  // AdaptiveSummarizer will be created lazily with API key
  console.log('[TabSense Offscreen] AdaptiveSummarizer will be created with API key when needed');
  
  // Skip ContextEnhancer (may use storage)
  console.log('[TabSense Offscreen] Skipping ContextEnhancer (may use storage not available in offscreen)');
  
  console.log('[TabSense Offscreen] Heavy modules initialized');
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `tabsense/src/background/offscreen.js`
   - Removed problematic imports
   - Modified `initializeHeavyModules()` to skip storage-using modules
   - Updated `handleAdaptiveSummarize()` to request API keys from service worker
   - Create `AdaptiveSummarizer` instance dynamically with API key

## Testing
1. Build successful: `offscreen.js` now 184.09 KB (down from 189.78 KB)
2. Extension should now load without errors
3. Offscreen document should initialize successfully
4. Adaptive summarization should work when API key is configured

## Next Steps
1. **Test the extension** - Load it in Chrome and check console
2. **Verify offscreen logs** - Should see:
   - `[TabSense Offscreen] ═══ Offscreen document loaded ═══`
   - `[TabSense Offscreen] Skipping CredentialManager...`
   - `[TabSense Offscreen] ContentScorer initialized`
   - No errors about `chrome.storage.local`
3. **Test summarization** - Open a content page and verify it generates summaries
4. **Verify API key flow** - Check that API keys are retrieved from service worker

## Build Output
```
dist/offscreen.js        184.09 kB │ gzip:  35.98 kB
dist/background.js        43.44 kB │ gzip:   7.29 kB
```

Both files are within acceptable limits.
