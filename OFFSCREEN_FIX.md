# Offscreen Document Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added `createOffscreenDocument()` method** - Properly creates the offscreen document during service worker initialization
2. **Updated `autoProcessTab()`** - Now calls the adaptive summarizer via offscreen instead of using basic extractive summaries
3. **Fixed offscreen.html** - Added `type="module"` to script tag to support ES6 imports
4. **Cleaned up offscreen.js** - Removed duplicate dynamic imports

## How It Works Now

1. Service worker creates offscreen document on initialization
2. When a tab is auto-processed, service worker sends a message to offscreen with the content
3. Offscreen document loads heavy modules (AdaptiveSummarizer, AIAdapter, etc.)
4. Offscreen document processes the content and returns the summary
5. Service worker receives the summary and stores the tab data

## Build Output

- **background.js**: 42.06 KB (within 60KB limit)
- **offscreen.js**: 189.76 KB (all heavy modules isolated)
- **offscreen.html**: Properly bundled and copied to dist/

## Next Steps

The extension should now work with full AI summarization. Test by:
1. Loading a content tab (news article, blog post, etc.)
2. Opening the extension
3. Checking the generated summary
4. Looking for any errors in the console
